This is a slider puzzle solver written in Java.

The program allows you to upload a picture, divide it up into N x N pieces,
shuffle the pieces, and then shuffles them.  Then, it checks to see if the 
puzzle is solvable - if it is, then it solves the puzzle and shows each move.
If it's not solvable, then it says so.

(One problem with this program: if the puzzle needs more than 40 moves, then it
fails (unless one allocates more memory)).
